This project compiles and runs properly in Visual Studio 2019. It is an experimental project to utilize a second windows form as a dialog.

It is, however, not correct.  When '#include "MyForm11.h"  ' is put in this file, the code from MyForm11.h is apparently NOT included.
To make this project compile and execute, I manually coppied the code from MyForm11.h and inserted it into MyForm.h

Some of the files in the git repository are not now used in this project.

Clerly, something  is wrong.  If anyone can tell me why the include did not work I will appreciate it. I am just learning to use Visual Studio.
