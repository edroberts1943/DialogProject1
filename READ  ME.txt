This project compiles and runs properly in Visual Studio 2019. It is an experimental project to utilize a second windows form as a dialog.

It is, however, not correct.  When '#include "MyForm11.h"  ' is put in MyForm.h, the code from MyForm11.h is apparently NOT included.
To make this project compile and execute, I manually coppied the code from MyForm11.h and inserted it into MyForm.h

Some of the files in the git repository are not now used in this project.

Clerly, something  is wrong.  If anyone can tell me why the include did not work I will appreciate it. I am just learning to use Visual Studio.
Please contact me at ed.roberts@verizon.net.



Here is what this project does:

It opens with a Windows form havnig a single button, "Open Dialog".
When the Open Dialog button is clicked upon, a dilog is opened that has a calendar control.
That is all it does. It is an experiment to utilize two Windows form classes in a Visual Studio 2019 C++ CLR GUI application.
